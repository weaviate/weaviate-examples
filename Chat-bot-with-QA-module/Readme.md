**This example makes use of the [qa-module](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/v1.11.0/reader-generator-modules/qna-transformers.html) of weaviate to make a chatbot/FAQ-bot/INFO-bot** <br><br>

To run the example, setup an environment using the requirements.txt file and perform the following steps:<br>
1. Run "docker-compose up -d" in the same directory as the example.<br>
2. Run the command "python qa.py" to add data to weaviate.<br>
3. Run the command "python app.py" to start the flask server and use the interface."<br><br>

Below are some screenshots of the bot:<br><br>
The interface shown below will be available at "http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:5000/chatbot"<br><br>

You can add the texts of your choice to the qa.py file. For demonstration purposes, I have used Apollo missions as a topic on which we can chat with the bot.<br>
Feel free to reach out if you run into any errors using this example.<br>
Have a great time using weaviate !! ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡
