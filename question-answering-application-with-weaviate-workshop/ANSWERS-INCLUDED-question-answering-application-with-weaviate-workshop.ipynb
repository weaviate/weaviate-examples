In this workshop and with this notebook you: learn what vector search is, perform your first semantic search with a prepared demo dataset and build your own vector search application with Question Answering. We'll use a dataset of newspaper articles, but you are free to use your own dataset instead! Besides running each cell, there are some **exercises** defined, in which you need to take some action like coming up with data sources, finishing a data schema and making creative queries.\n",

    "Traditional search engines perform a *keyword-based search*. Such search engines return results that contain an exact match or a close variation of a search query, like searching for papers about *“Covid-19“*. Those *keyword-based* search engines work well in some cases, but fall short in use cases where *semantics* play a role. This means that traditional search engines do not take the actual meaning of the query and documents or data into account. Documents in a database that might be of interest might not be found, because different wording is used. This means that, for example, a paper with the word *“coronavirus”* in it will not be found with the search term *“Covid-19“*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Vector-based search* (or semantic search, neural search) tries to solve this problem. Vector search engines like [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) retrieve documents by meaning, not by exact matching keywords. With machine learning models like BERT or ResNet50, a vector database converts data objects (text, images, etc) to embeddings. Embeddings are vector representations, which are stored in a high-dimensional vector space. The following image shows a simplified example of embedded concepts and images. Note that some of the name *“cat”* lies close to an image of a cat. And that *“dog”* lies closer to *“cat”* than *“banana“*. \n",

    "If we would search for *“kitten”* in our simple database, the machine learning model would calculate a vector for this word, and return the closest data points. Although there is no datapoint matching exactly the word *“kitten“*, the vector search engine would return objects like the image of the cat, because this is *semantically* close to the query. This is visualized in the following figure:\n",

    "**Using Weaviate to do a vector-based search**\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate is an open-source vector-based search engine. With Weaviate you can perform a semantic search to various data types (text, images, etc) as described above. To embed data and queries, you can use out-of-the-box models, use open models (e.g. from HuggingFace), or connect your own machine learning model. Weaviate is horizontally scalable, which enables you to scale ML models and search through big data very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try out a semantic search demo**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a glimpse of how semantic search in practice works, you can try out the following demo. This demo contains a small dataset of around 3500 news articles, which are embedded with a [BERT model](https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english). You can access this dataset on https://demo.dataset.playground.semi.technology. Using the [Weaviate Console](https://console.semi.technology/), you can query this dataset. You can use [this link](https://link.semi.technology/37kMdjR) to access the GraphQL query module on this dataset directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the following GraphQL query, you search the dataset for *Articles* that are around the topic of *“kitten”*. The query *“kitten”* will be vectorized using the BERT model, and *Articles* that are close to this vector will be retrieved. The title of the top articles along with the calculated *“certainty”* (ranging from 0.0-1.0) are shown. \n",

    "When creating a Weaviate cluster, we also need to define which *vectorizer* (retriever) module we will use. A list of available modules can be found [here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/modules/index.html). For this tutorial we use a [`text2vec-transformers` module](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-transformers.html) to vectorize data and queries. The specific Transformers models is [sentence-transformers-paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2) and is available on HuggingFace. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this model is a vectorizer (or retriever or encoder) model, which calculates vectors from data, we can extend the search pipeline with a *reader* model. Reader models will be called after a *retriever* model retrieved a list of candidate search results from the query. An example of a reader model is a Question Answering model. This model will try to find an answer to a question posed in the query in the list of candidate data points that were returned by the retriever model. In this tutorial, we will add such a Question Answering model to the pipeline, in this case the pretrained [bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad) which is also available on HuggingFace. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can choose to use the `text2vec-contextionary` module or one of the other `text2vec-transformers` modules to vectorize text. Keep in mind that the free 'sandbox' Weaviate cluster that you get from WCS runs on CPU only, so Transformer models can be slower to import/vectorize data. `text2vec-contextionary` module vectorize text faster. If you want to experiment with a `text2vec-transformers` module, you are advised to run a Weaviate locally or on your cloud and enable GPU. You can change the `module` config parameter to for example (available models can be found [here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-transformers.html)):\n",
